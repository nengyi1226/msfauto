Some msfvenom auto-generating tools
I will update from time to time.
Due to copyright issues, this program does not provide carrier exe, please collect on the Internet by yourself, any Windows gadget can (must be. exe),
move it to the msfauto directory.
For learning and communication only, any other use is at your own risk.
If the main program doesn't work, assign a value to a script that ends with ".sh" and use it temporarily, I will release the main program with higher compatibility as soon as possible, sorry.
